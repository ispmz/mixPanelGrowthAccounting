# growth_accounting_and_ltv.js
The JQL version of Jonathan Hsu's Growth Accounting and Ltv SQL statement.

The first query here will grab your data and turn it into a table that can easily produce the chart in the "Lifetime Value of Everything Else" section of Jonathan's post. (https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-4-cohorts-and-engagement-ltv-80b4fa7f8e41#.242btb6t7)

For code that translates this table into a pretty highcharts chart, see the 'chart' file.
